## About
 I created this project to demonstrate the capabilities of Next.js and Tailwind CSS in building a responsive and dynamic web application. It serves as a learning resource for developers looking to enhance their skills in modern web development. I wanted to explore how these technologies can be used together to create a seamless user experience. Through this project, I aim to share my knowledge and help others understand the potential of these tools in building scalable and maintainable web applications.
